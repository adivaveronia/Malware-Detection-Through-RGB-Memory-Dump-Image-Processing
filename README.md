# Malware-Detection-Through-RGB-Memory-Dump-Image-Processing

This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for my undergraduate thesis project. This research focuses on malware detection using memory forensics, computer vision, and  techniques. The approaches leverages RGB images generated from memory dump data and applies machine learning algorithms to accurately detect and classify malware. The complete title for this research is "Malware Detection Through RGB Memory Dump Image Processing Using HOG Descriptor, UMAP, and Machine Learning Method", you can read the full paper in this ![link](Documentation/Paper.pdf).

## Project Overview
The rapid increase in global internet users and the advancment of technology have both provided significant benefits and introduced complex cybersecurity challenges. Among these challenges is the detection of sophisticated malware, which often hides its movements to evade traditional detection methods. This research focuses on leveraging memory forensics, an essential technique for uncovering hidden malware activities, by transforming memory dump datasets into RGB images and employing computer vision techniques for effective malware detection.

## Key Techniques and Methods
1. Data Collection: Obtain RGB images from a memory dump dataset or through this [link]
2. Image Resizing: Resize images to 256x256 pixels.
3. Feature Extraction: Utilize Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor to extract features from the resized images.
4. Dimensionality Reduction: Apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to reduce the dimensionality of the extracted features.
5. Standardization: Standardize the features to ensure consistency.
6. Machine Learning Models: Train and test the data using various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
7. Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this research consists of 4294 samples, with images sized 224x224 and 300x300 pixels, generating 34956 feature vectors. Each image was resized and features were extracted and reduced to 4 dimensions. The dataset includes ratio of different malware families (adware, trojan, virus, worm) and benign samples.

## Research Findings
This experiments demonstrated that the choice of UMAP (supervised or unsupervised) significantly impacts the performance of machine learning models. Notably, KNN achieved the highest accuracy of 90.5% with data reduced using unsupervised UMAP. The following insights were observed:
* KNN performs well with unsupervised UMAP and 300x300 image sizes.
* Multinomial Logistic Regression and SVM (RBF) excel with supervised UMAP.
* Logistic Regression is effective with 224x224 image sizes.

## Conclusion
This research underscore the potential of combining memory forensics and machine learning with computer vision techniques to enhance malware detection capabilities. By leveraging RGB images and sophisticated feature extraction and dimensionality reduction methods, we can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of malware detection systems.

## Recommendation
Despite the progress made, there are several areas for improvement that can enhance the effectiveness of the malware detection system in future research. Here are some recommendations:
1. Expand the Dataset: Increase the volume and diversity of the dataset to improve the robustness and generalizability of the model.
2. Ensure Dataset Balance: Maintain a balanced ratio of different classes within the dataset to achieve higher accuracy and prevent class imbalance issues.
3. Explore Alternative Algorithms: Consider using other feature extraction and dimensionality reduction techniques such as SIFT and t-SNE. Evaluate the potential of deep learning algorithms for feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and classification to achieve better results.
4. Comprehensive Model Evaluation: Use comprehensive metrics like ROC-AUC and precision-recall curves to evaluate the model's performance thoroughly, providing a deeper understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.

By addressing these recommendations, future research can further enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of malware detection systems.

This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for my undergraduate thesis project. This research focuses on malware detection using memory forensics, computer vision, and  techniques. The approaches leverages RGB images generated from memory dump data and applies machine learning algorithms to accurately detect and classify malware. The complete title for this research is 

## Project Overview
The rapid increase in global internet users and the advancment of technology have both provided significant benefits and introduced complex cybersecurity challenges. Among these challenges is the detection of sophisticated malware, which often hides its movements to evade traditional detection methods. This research focuses on leveraging memory forensics, an essential technique for uncovering hidden malware activities, by transforming memory dump datasets into RGB images and employing computer vision techniques for effective malware detection.

## Key Techniques and Methods
1. Data Collection: Obtain RGB images from a memory dump dataset or through this [link]
2. Image Resizing: Resize images to 256x256 pixels.
3. Feature Extraction: Utilize Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor to extract features from the resized images.
4. Dimensionality Reduction: Apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to reduce the dimensionality of the extracted features.
5. Standardization: Standardize the features to ensure consistency.
6. Machine Learning Models: Train and test the data using various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
7. Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy.

## Research Findings
This experiments demonstrated that the choice of UMAP (supervised or unsupervised) significantly impacts the performance of machine learning models. Notably, KNN achieved the highest accuracy of 90.5% with data reduced using unsupervised UMAP. The following insights were observed:
* KNN performs well with unsupervised UMAP and 300x300 image sizes.
* Multinomial Logistic Regression and SVM (RBF) excel with supervised UMAP.
* Logistic Regression is effective with 224x224 image sizes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this research use 224x224 and 300x300 pixel of images and consists of 4294 samples, generating 34956 feature vectors. Each image was resized and features were extracted and reduced to 4 dimensions. The dataset includes ratio of different malware families (adware, trojan, virus, worm) and benign samples.

## Conclusion
This research underscore the potential of combining memory forensics with computer vision techniques to enhance malware detection capabilities. By leveraging RGB images and sophisticated feature extraction and dimensionality reduction methods, we can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of malware detection systems.
